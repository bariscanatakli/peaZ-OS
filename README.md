## üìñ Project Explanation

The Terminal Portfolio project is designed to provide an interactive and engaging way to showcase a portfolio. It mimics a terminal interface, allowing users to navigate through different sections using commands. The project is built using modern web technologies such as Next.js, React, and Firebase.

### How It Works

1. **Terminal Interface** : The main interface of the portfolio is a terminal-like window where users can type commands to navigate through different sections.
2. **Multiple Window Support** : Users can open multiple terminal windows, each running independently, allowing for multitasking.
3. **File System Navigation** : The terminal interface supports basic file system commands like `ls`, `cd`, and `cat` to explore content.
4. **Project Showcase** : Users can view detailed information about various projects by navigating to the respective sections using commands.
5. **Skills Listing** : The `skills` command displays a list of categorized technical and soft skills.
6. **Contact Form** : The `contact` command displays contact information and links to social media profiles.
7. **Anonymous Authentication** : Firebase authentication allows users to interact with the terminal without signing in.

### Example Commands

* `about` - Displays information about the author.
* `projects` - Lists all projects with options to view details.
* `skills` - Shows a categorized list of skills.
* `contact` - Provides contact information and social media links.
